	<h3>Functions</h3>
	<p class=func><span class=keyword>play</span>(filename);</p>
	<p class=desc>Begin playing a WAV file.  If a file is already playing,
		it is stopped and this file starts playing from the beginning.
	</p>
	<p class=func><span class=keyword>stop</span>();</p>
	<p class=desc>Stop playing.  If not playing, this function has no effect.
	</p>
	<p class=func><span class=keyword>isPlaying</span>();</p>
	<p class=desc>Return true (non-zero) if playing, or false (zero)
		when not playing.  See the note below about delayed start.
	</p>
	<p class=func><span class=keyword>positionMillis</span>();</p>
	<p class=desc>While playing, return the current time offset, in
		milliseconds.  When not playing, the return from this function
		is undefined.
	</p>
	<p class=func><span class=keyword>lengthMillis</span>();</p>
	<p class=desc>Return the total length of the current sound clip,
		in milliseconds.  When not playing, the return from this function
		is undefined.
	</p>

	<h3>Notes</h3>
	<p>Only 16 bit PCM, 44100 Hz WAV files are supported.  When mono
		files are played, both output ports transmit a copy of the
		single sound.  Of course, stereo WAV files play with the left
		channel on port 0 and the right channel on port 1.
	</p>
	<p>A brief delay after calling play() will usually occur before
		isPlaying() returns true and positionMillis() returns valid
		time offset.  WAV files have a header at the beginning of the
		file, which the audio library must read and parse before
		playing can begin.
	</p>
	<p>While playing, the audio library accesses the SD card automatically.
		If card access is required, you must
		<a href="http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_AudioProcessorUsage.html" target="_blank">use AudioNoInterrupts()</a>
		to prevent the library from accessing the SD card while you use it.
		Disabling the audio library interrupt for too long may cause audible
		dropouts or glitches.
